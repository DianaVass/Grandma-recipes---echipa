    <p><b>ABOUT</b></p>
    <p>Back in 2000 I ordered a couple of gag gifts from Seattle based merchant Archie McPhee. When my packages arrived they were kind enough to include a few “gifts with purchase.”  These free treasures were sets of The Complete Family Recipe CardTM Series Collection.</p>
    <p>For years I kept these in my own recipe binder wondering just what to do with such iconic visions of the bygone era that was the 1970’s. In 2009, while blogging regularly on Salon’s Open Salon site, I started posting these cards. The cards became an instant hit, and many were given the site’s coveted “Editor’s Pick” and featured on the front page of the site.</p>
    <p>I have also shared the cards on the Jacksonville, FL food and restaurant review site Eat Jax, where they have become a guilty pleasure for some of the city’s elite palettes.  Doesn’t matter who you are or how gourmand you think you, these treasures touch the heart and gastric system in a very special way.</p>
    <p>I have now decided to gather all of my treasures here in one happy collection of gastronomic ecstasy.  Read, enjoy, and share.  If you’ve got recipe cards stashed in your closet that you’d like to share, just send me an email!</p>
